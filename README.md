# Tiw
> The Norse god of war and adjudication.
> Pronounced _tyew_ (like the first part of the word **Tue**sday).

Tiw is (/will be) a command-line tool for adjudicating the
board game Diplomacy.

It uses an SQL-like script to affect the games, and returns
a string representation of the game's state after each
operation.
